I am a backend developer, have been coding for 4 years, 
I love to solve coding problems but now i am planning to keep all my code over here so that i can watch review and get motivated by myself.
that's it about this repo, if it is anyhow useful for anyone, just consider it is for you, if any feedback or suggestion, please drop a mail or msg, suggestion is welcome. 
Thank You.
